### Hi, I'm Luan — Backend Developer & Cloud Enthusiast

I build robust, scalable backend systems that keep real-world businesses running smoothly.  
Over the last years, I've worked across e-commerce, finance, and industrial operations, mostly using **Java (Spring Boot)** and **Python**, all wrapped in **cloud-native** architectures on Azure.

Clean code, solid design principles, and performance tuning are where I feel at home.  
I enjoy transforming complex domains into elegant, maintainable systems.
